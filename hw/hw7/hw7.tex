\section{}% Problem 1
 Given a connected undirected graph $G = (V,E)$, let $n = |V |$ and $m
 = |E|$. We say a vertex $v$ is removable if we remove $v$ and all its
 incident edges from $G$, the rest of the graph is still connected. See Fig. 1 for an example.

Design an $O(n + m)$ time algorithm to find a removable vertex (you only need to find one
removable vertex although there may be multiple such vertices). (Hint: use BFS or DFS
search.) {\bf (20 points)}

\section{}% Problem 2

 Given a directed graph $G = (V,E)$, let $n = |V |$ and $m =
 |E|$. Every edge $(u,v)$ of $G$ has a nonnegative weight $w(u,v) \le
 0$. Let $s$ and $t$ be two vertices in $G$. The length of a path in
 $G$ is the sum of the weights of all edges in the path. A shortest
 path from $s$ to $t$ is a path with minimum length among all paths in
 $G$ from $s$ to $t$. In class, we discussed Dijkstra's algorithm for
 finding shortest paths. 

Note that there may be multiple different shortest paths from $s$ to
$t$ in $G$ (i.e., these paths may have different edges but their
lengths are the same). In some applications, we may want to find a
shortest path from $s$ to $t$ that has edges as few as possible. A
path $\pi$ in $G$ from $s$ to $t$ is said to be optimal if (1)$\pi$
is a shortest path from $s$ to $t$, and (2) among all shortest paths
from $s$ to $t$, $\pi$ has the minimum number of edges. 

Modify Dijkstra's algorithm to compute an optimal path from $s$ to
$t$. Your algorithm should have the same time complexity as Dijkstra's
algorithm. {\bf (20 points)}

\section{} %Problem 3

 Given a directed graph $G = (V,E)$, let $n = |V |$ and $m =
 |E|$. Every edge $(u,v)$ of $G$ has a non-negative weight $w(u,v) \ge
 0$. The bottleneck weight of any path in $G$ is defined to be the
 largest weight of all edges in the path. Let $s$ and $t$ be two
 vertices of $G$. A bottleneck shortest path from $s$ to $t$ is a path
 with minimum bottleneck weight among all paths from $s$ to $t$ in $G$.

Modify Dijkstra's algorithm to compute a bottleneck shortest path from
$s$ to $t$. Your algorithm should have the same time complexity as
Dijkstra's algorithm. {\bf (20 points)}
